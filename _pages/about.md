Hello ! I’m Katia Chardon, a PhD student in the [NeuroPhysics](https://ciel.neurospin.fr/teams/ciel-neurophysics.html) team at [NeuroSpin](https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx), CEA Paris Saclay, France. I’m working under the supervision of [Davide Boido](https://davideboido.github.io/), Charles Laidi and Luisa Ciobanu on functional connectivity and excitability of the cerebellum in schizophrenia patients and mouse models.

I completed my master degree in Data and AI at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), where I developed an interest in AI applied to neurosciences. My research interests include Machine Learning, Neurosciences and Neuroimaging. I am particularly interested in identifying biotypes of psychiatric disorders to better understand underlying causes, improve and accelerate diagnosis, and contribute to the development of more targeted treatments.
