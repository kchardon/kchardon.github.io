Hello ! I’m Katia Chardon, a PhD student in the [NeuroPhysics](https://ciel.neurospin.fr/teams/ciel-neurophysics.html) team at [NeuroSpin](https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx), CEA Paris Saclay, France. I’m working under the supervision of [Davide Boido](https://davideboido.github.io/), Charles Laidi and Luisa Ciobanu on functional connectivity and excitability of the cerebellum in schizophrenia patients and mouse models.

I completed my master degree in Data and AI at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), where I developed an interest in AI applied to neurosciences and psychiatry. My research interests include Machine Learning, Neuroimaging and Precision Psychiatry. I am interested in identifying brain biotypes and patterns of dysconnectivity across psychiatric disorders to advance precision psychiatry, translate findings using mouse models, and support the development of novel, targeted treatments, including brain stimulation.
