Hello ! I’m Katia Chardon, a PhD student in the [Neurophysics](https://neurospin.github.io/ciel/teams/ciel-neurophysics.html) team at [NeuroSpin](https://joliot.cea.fr/drf/joliot/Pages/Entites_de_recherche/NeuroSpin.aspx), CEA Paris Saclay. I’m working under the supervision of [Davide Boido](https://davideboido.github.io/), Charles Laidi and Luisa Ciobanu on functional connectivity and excitability of the cerebellum in schizophrenia patients and mouse models.

My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Neuroimaging. I am interested in exploring how AI can help improve mental illnesses diagnosis and care.

I completed my master degree in Data and AI at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/), where I developed an interest in AI applied to neurosciences.
